				<p>Perception of area versus magnitude varies per person. The perceived area of a circle grows more slowly than the actual:perceived area = (actual area)(.8Â±.3) So if the area is 4, the range of perceived area ranges from 2 =4(.5) to 6 =4(1.1) and if the circle's area grows to 8 then the perceived area could be from 3 =8(.5) to 15 =8(1.1). That is, if the area doubled, some might only see a 50% increase where others might see a 150% increase in the same visual.Using two dimensional objects to represent scalars is naturally misleading-- especially if you use the diameter as proportional to the scalars to view. Growth of a scalar value becomes perceived to be squared. Be sure the areas are what you really represent if you use such objects.</p>
